  "Type": "Ground Unit",
  "Description": "The Immortal is a heavily armored Protoss robotic strider that excels at destroying armored ground targets. Its Barrier ability absorbs high-damage attacks, making it exceptionally durable against burst damage. With its powerful phase disruptors that deal bonus damage to armored units, the Immortal serves as the backbone of many Protoss ground compositions.",

  "Competitive Usage": {
    "General": "The Immortal has become the premier anchor unit for Protoss ground armies in Legacy of the Void. Its Barrier ability makes it exceptionally durable against high-damage attacks from units like Siege Tanks and Lurkers. When combined with Warp Prism micro, Immortals can be repositioned to maximize damage output while minimizing incoming fire. They provide excellent value against armored compositions but struggle against swarms of light units.",
    "Vs. Protoss": "Core unit in PvP, particularly effective against Stalkers and Colossi. With +1 weapons, Immortals can kill Stalkers in just 3 shots. However, they are vulnerable to Zealot surrounds and must be protected by their own Gateway units. The Immortal vs Colossus dynamic often determines the outcome of ground engagements.",
    "Vs. Terran": "Extremely effective against mech compositions, shredding Siege Tanks, Thors, and Marauders. The Barrier ability allows them to withstand tank volleys. Against bio compositions, they require support from splash damage units like Colossi or High Templar to handle Marine swarms. Immortal drops with Warp Prisms can be devastating against undefined bases.",
    "Vs. Zerg": "Essential against Roach-based armies and crucial for countering Lurker and Ultralisk transitions. While less effective against pure Hydralisk or Zergling compositions, they provide important insurance against tech switches. Should be supported by Sentries for Force Fields and Gateway units for protection against lighter Zerg units."
