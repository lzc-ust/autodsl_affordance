  "Description": "The Viking is a versatile Terran transforming unit that serves as both an anti-air fighter and ground assault walker. With exceptional range in Fighter Mode, it excels at establishing air superiority and countering high-value armored air targets. While its Assault Mode sees limited use, the Viking's aerial dominance makes it crucial for supporting ground armies against air threats and providing vision.",

  "Competitive Usage": {
    "General": "Vikings are specialized anti-air units that excel at establishing air control and countering specific high-value targets. Their 9 range allows them to outrange most air units and provide crucial vision for siege units. Vikings are typically produced in specific numbers to counter enemy air compositions rather than massed continuously. Proper positioning and focus fire are essential for maximizing their effectiveness.",
    "Vs. Protoss": "Essential for countering Colossus-based armies, as Vikings can safely pick them off from maximum range. Effective against Void Rays, Carriers, and Tempests. Vulnerable to Phoenix swarms and Stalker focus fire. Often paired with bio armies to handle Protoss air transitions and provide aerial vision for engagements.",
    "Vs. Terran": "Core unit in TvT for air superiority battles. Critical for protecting siege tank lines and denying enemy vision. Vikings determine air control, which directly impacts tank effectiveness through vision advantage. Vulnerable to mass Marine compositions and Thor anti-air. The Jotun Boosters upgrade significantly enhances their kiting capability.",
    "Vs. Zerg": "Primary counter to Brood Lords and effective against Corruptor-based compositions. Can snipe Overlords for supply denial and scouting disruption. Vulnerable to Fungal Growth and Parasitic Bomb when clumped. Requires careful positioning and spreading against spellcaster support. Often used in late-game mech compositions to handle Zerg's aerial threats."
